 <h5 id="related-academic-work">Web-based Data Visualization</h5>
  <p>Information Visualization is an old discipline that developed in the 1600s. With renewed interest in the workings of the physical world, networks of amateur scientists needed visual means to communicate ideas. Using pen and paper, inline sketching of the moons of Jupiter (Galileo) or of sunspots traversing the Sun's surface (Christoph Scheiner) recorded and diseminated the discoveries of early scientists. Since then, visualizers have used the technology at hand to encode available information and data in visual form. This section will layout a few broad movements in the history of information visualization. These movements are defined both by the technology available to the visualizer as well as the data they have access to. The section will conclude with a more detailed history of information visualizations that use the Internet and world wide web as a canvas.</p>

  <h6>Early Scientific Visualization</h6>
  <p>With the rekindling of the scientific investigation in Europe, scientists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries needed a method to record their observations of the natural world and share their complex findings. Many began to turn to drawing and sketching as a method to record and share. One such scientist was the Jesuit priest and astronomer Christoph Scheiner who used information visualization to record, then publicize, his findings about sunspots [5]. In 1611, Scheiner began recording the sunspots he observed using pen and paper. In 1626, Scheiner published "Tres Epistolae de Maculis Solaribus Scriptae ad Marcum Welserum" ("Three Letters on Solar Spots written to Marc Welser"). In these letters, Scheiner included small-multiple diagrams of his recordings. The grid of profiles of the sun showed the progression of sun spots as they progressed around the surface of the sun. The publication used etched plates to duplicate Sheiner's visualization. Few copies of Scheiner's letters were produced.</p>
  <p>Scheiner's sunspots exemplify the Scientific Visualization era. The data Scheiner visualized was data he had personally observed. To visualize what he saw, he used the tools available to him: pen and paper. He shared his visualization with other highly educated scientistsâ€”the letters were written in Latin and required extensive knowledge of astronomy. So expensive data, expensive production, and limited audience made visualization a specialists tool. Only the most educated would encounter an infovis in during this period.</p>

  <p>These visualizations all had characteristics in common. Because the data gathered was limited to the naked eye (or one with a small telescope), most of the visualizations were about the natural world. The first modern atlas appeared a half century before Scheiner's sunspot visualizations. The first visual representation of statistical data appeared showing variations in estimates of the longitutude between Rome and Toledo. The first published image of the camera obscura showed a diagram of how the machine worked. These projects were taking commonly experience phenomema, abstracting them, and then publishing the visualizations.

  <h6>Bureaucratic Infovis</h6>
  <p>
    The Bureaucratic Visualization era occurred when the limits that scientists like Scheiner experienced were lifted. As these limits were reduced, an explosion of new visualizations occurred. This explosion's size and variety have earned the mid- to late-nineteenth century the title of Infovis's Golden Age[6]. Friendly explains the antecedents of this golden age as being: new statistics recorded by the nation-state, new statistics recorded about social activity, new methods of statistical analysis, new methods of print production, and new advances in the visual language of graphs [7].

    One of the most famous graphs of this golden age illustrates the great change in data-gathering, technology, and communication. Florence Nightingale introduced her landmark visualization, "Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East" in 1858 when she she sent to Queen Victoria her book on the mortality rates of the British Army in the Crimean War. In this visualization, Nightingale performed two sets of comparisons. She first compared the number of British soldiers who died in the Crimean War due to preventable disease, wounds, and other. She then separated the graph to before and after March 1855, when a delegation of Sanitary Commissioners arrived in Crimea to improve sanitation in camps. The graph showed in one graphic that soldiers were far likelier to die of preventable disease and that the arrival of the commissioners correlated with a drop in these preventable deaths.

    Nightingale wasn't the first to use the polar-area or coxcomb diagram. But she was the earliest prominent example of a person using infovis for persuasive and popular impact. She is quoted by Ehyde and Seneta as saying that her goal for all her visualizations was "to affect thro' the Eyes what we fail to convey to the public through their word-proof ears" [8]. She sent her book to Queen Mary and published it so that anyone interested could see her argument rather having to hear about using their "word-proof ears." Nightingale collaborated with the British epidemiologist William Farr for over two decades. Her unique contribution to the partnership was, according to Ehyde and Seneta, "a flair for publicizing their statistical findings through the use of diagrams." John Tukey, the 20th century statistician, referred to this persuasive quality as "interocularity," a graphic whose message hits you right between the eyes [9].

      Other visualizers like Charles Joseph Minard, Andre-Michel Guerry, and Francis Galton also contributed richly designed visualizations [10]. Minard's flow map of Napoleon's march to Russia is perhaps the most famous visualization ever. Andre-Michel Guerry took crime statistics&mdash;a novel piece of data first tabulated by the Paris police department&mdash;and released thematic maps of crime throughout France. Francis Galton published seventeen articles dealing how charts could be used for meteorology. The London <em>Times</em> published one of his weather charts in 1875. It was the first instance of a modern weather map published in newspapers.

      After the infovis golden age, interest in the field waned. New methods of summary statistics were developed that were considered more accurate and "true" to the data.[11] Infovis which was hand-drawn, and painstakingly produced appeared old and Victorian. From 1900 to 1950, there was little to note in infovis developments.

  <p>In the past ten years, the internet has created the ability to connect internet users together and allow them to access and share a collective experience, often in real time. The ability for users to connect with each other through a centralized system has revolutionized the field of information visualization. Today, it is easier to distribute, customize, quickly modify, and receive feedback from visualizations than ever before.</p>
