    <h1>Welcome to Pittsburgh!</h1>
    <p>Help new Pittsburghers acclimate to the city by creating a housing guide that provides relevant  information about various Pittsburgh neighborhoods. Find a context and ground your design in the audience and location.</p>

    <h6>Picking an overall goal for my poster and gathering possible lists of data.</h6>
    <p>I've changed cities often in my life, and I know the greatest challenge new residents face is finding a good home in a neighborhood that suits their personality. </p>
    <p>With this personal experience, I knew my goal for this poster would be to create a housing guide for new residents that would quickly orient and educate them about the neighborhoods surrounding Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
    <p>Looking through my raw statistical and qualitative data, I gathered stats and stories that might interest new residents. CMU has many classes of new residents, so my next step was to figure out what kinds of new residents I wanted to target.</p>

    <h5 class="red">LOCATION AND CONTEXT</h5>
    <h6>Finding the most relevant audience for the research collected.</h6>
    <p>With the set of initial data I had created, I wanted to discover a context that was most approriate for the data, and I wanted to discover a particular group of new residents that could most use my research.</p>
    <p>Without research, I began by considering the entire universe of new Pittsburgh residents. As I talked to a variety of new residents, I “tried on” a variety of groups such as new undergraduates, new faculty, new employees, new campus security officers. I tested my design ideas for these different groups through rapid sketching, then I re-evaluated if I thought my poster would be useful.</p>

    <h5 class="red">VISUAL IMPLEMENTATION</h5>
    <h6>Creating a good design to convey the message.</h6>
    <p>As the data and context research occurred, the visual design began to arrise from the research. There were two goals for the visuals:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Different levels of information designed to be scanned at different physical distances</li>
      <li>A clear layout that allowed the user to quickly compare neighborhoods</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
The greatest challenge for me was finding the right level of visual complexity that would give a rich and informative viewing experience without overwhelming the viewer or requiring the viewer to spend a long amount of time studying the poster.</p>
    <p>The final guide invites viewers to read it but also provides a wealth of information the closer they get.</p>

    <h5 class="red">Printing &amp; Reflection</h5>
    <h6>Making the poster and learning more <br/>about what is Design.</h6>
    <p>My background is in web and interface design, so the chance to actually print this poster instead of viewing it on the internet was pretty exciting. Having to think about the print color, color modes, and the relationship between my screen size and final poster size forced me to be much more thoughtful about my final design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned a lot from this project about the process of design. I thought through not just how I wanted the design to look, but I considered who would be viewing the design and where they'd view it and why they'd want to view it. I discovered that these deeper considerations are actually the kind of design I'm interested in executing. Visual design is essential, but there's so much more to think about and discover.</p>
