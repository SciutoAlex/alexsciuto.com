    <h5 class="red">Our Solution</h5>
    <h6>The GardenPot system provides gardeners information about their gardens even when they are not present in the garden.</h6>
    <p>We created a system that brings information about the community garden into the home. The GardenPot system consists of two main parts. In the garden, moisture, temperature, and pressure sensors record both human and plant activity. This information is relayed to each gardener's own in-home GardenPot. The GardenPot displays this information in a natural form without resorting to screens and obvious technology. </p>

    <h5 class="red">Preliminary Research and Interviews</h5>
    <h6>Introducing ourselves to community gardening and talking to gardeners.</h6>
   <p>No one on the team had much experience with gardening, so we started the design process by immersing ourselves in the practice of community gardens. We connected with the members of a local community garden who graciously talked to us, brought us on gardening trips, and sat for interviews.</p>
    <p>We also read a variety of literature on the challenges of introducing ubiquitious computing solutions into outdoor settings. These challenges ranged from lighting to dealing with moisture and rain.</p>

    <h5 class="red">Speed Dating</h5>
    <h6>Using rapid testing to explore the social boundaries of ubiquitous computing</h6>
    <p>We speed dated with three gardeners to test what types of social activity and technology they would find acceptable in the garden. The speed dating process involved the team creating ten different scenarios to test how we could introduce technology into the garden. We took those storyboards, sat down with gardeners, walked them through the scenario, and watched their reactions.
    </p>
  <p>
      The results of speed-dating gave our design choices new specicifity, and made our idea gardener much more concrete. The speed dating sessions made it clear that our best chance for creating a useful innovation was in the following areas: Connecting gardeners to their fellow gardners, connecting gardeners with the wider neighborhood, and enabling gardeners to more easily share ripe food with one another.

    <h5 class="red">Three possible Directions</h5>
    <h6>We formulated three very provocative concepts and presented them to the class. Students were provoked. Our three concepts were:</h6>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Garden Book: A book mechanically records all the activity in the garden. Visitors can leave notes in the book. At the end of the year, the book is closed and is physical embodiment of the growing season.</li>
      <li>Garden Connect: Provide information and data about the state of the garden to gardeners in their home.</li>
      <li>Garden Chimes: Use in-garden alerts to encourage visitors in the garden to help take care of the garden. The system would give visitors the confidence that they were not unwelcome.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="red">Focusing the Concept</h5>
    <h6>Based on feedback from the class, we chose to focus on providing in-home information, but we needed to play with the form</h6>
    
    <p>Our interviews told us that gardeners didn't want obvious technology to enter into their garden experience. But we wanted to convey complex information about the garden in the gardeners' homes. We had to find a form that could convey the information we wanted to share while appearing natural.</p>
   <p> We were inspired by the simple terra cotta pot. Our "display" would take the form of a potted plant that would convey the information we wanted to share through physically changes to its form.</p>

    <h5 class="red">Video Sketch Script and Rough Draft</h5>
    <h6>We used the video sketch process to solidify our concept and its interactions.</h6>
    <p>Even though we knew the form we wanted the indicator to take, there were still many small questions that we needed to answer. How would the garden be able to sense plant growth? How would gardeners interact with the GardenPot indicator?</p>
    <p>We used the video sketch process to figure out these details. We created scripts, then storyboards, then rough cuts of the video, then finally began experimenting with our chosen illustation style.</p>
