      <h1>Explain a Complex Topic</h1>
      <p>Find a topic that is too hard or difficult to explain just through discussion. Is it too big? Too Fast? Too small? Too jargony? Create a short explanatory video that clearly explains your topic.</p>

    <div class="step">
      <strong>1. Basic Research</strong>
      <p>I had always known that Voyager 1 was the fastest-moving and farthest-from-earth human object, I needed to do research to learn about the exact distances and the exact structure of the solar system</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>2. Script Writing</strong>
      <p>Once I knew the basic points I wanted to highlight, I created a short script and honed the language I wanted to use and the video's pacing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>Storyboard</strong>
      <p>Once I had my basic script, I began sketching a variety of possible stories using storyboards. Should I base my video on time? On a loser narrative about Voyager?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <strong>4. Visual System</strong>
      <p>Finding an effective visual system that could convey the vast distances of space was a challenge. I tried one visual style which failed, and then I settled on a logarithmic scale approach.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>5. Video Production</strong>
      <p>Before this project, I had only dabbled with AfterEffects. After this video, I can say I know a lot about the program. It has a great scripting system based heavily on Javascript. Pretty cool.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <strong>6. Presentation</strong>
      <p>I showed the video to group of peers and visitors. The feedback was positive, and I was glad I made the choice to have a narratorless video.</p>

    <p>The storyboard process allowed me to quickly test different concepts and see if they would be useable.</p>

   <h5 class="red">Visual Styles</h5>
    <p>Two of my concepts I thought would equally work well. One was a highly geometric logarithmic scaling of the universe. The other physically situated the solar system in a local Pittsburgh park. I wasn't sure which I should try, so I did a small video test for both. Turned out the park idea didn't make much sense, but the logarithmic scaling was pretty cool!</p>
