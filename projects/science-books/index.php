    <h1>Childrens' Infographic Books</h1>
    <p>I worked with a children's book publisher to create two books of graphics that taught grade school children about energy and waves and natural disasters throughout history. Cool, I know.</p>

    <p>One of the interesting aspects of the project was discovering the role of the of the data designer within the book publishing process. Was I an author? Was I an illustrator? The publishers came to me with text already prepared and basic art direction. I think the value I added was seeing the publisher and author's ideas and concepts in more useful visual ways.
